<!--  re: type=”text/css”. If you're using HTML5 you can safely ignore it as it's no longer needed. HTML4 pages will throw an error on validation. -->
<!-- type="text/javascript". 
 This attribute is optional. Since Netscape 2, the default programming language in all browsers has been JavaScript. 
 In XHTML, this attribute is required and unnecessary. In HTML, it is better to leave it out. The browser knows what to do.

I use the type attribute since it's required for valid HTML. But practically, it serves no purpose.
and or
The HTML5 spec says the default type is text/javascript... so in HTML5 you can leave this blank in all cases 
where you are, in fact, scripting in Javascript. See the spec for more information.
In HTML4 the type attribute is required, so you should include it in that case if you are concerned about having "valid" HTML, 
obviously if Crockford is saying the attribute is not needed, there is no apparent downside to invalid HTML in this case.
